The project was built to ensure a sustainable energy distribution across the European Union, especially as gas prices reached record highs in Europe \u2013 which gets more than a third of its natural gas from Russia.\n\nAs the conflict continues in Ukraine, European gas prices have soared and there is the likelihood that Moscow could shut off supplies of gas, widely considered part of Putin\u2019s leverage against the West in his obsession with Ukraine.\n\nBefore that, European countries will be pulling the stops to find contingency supply networks in the coming weeks. In fact, sources say the United States is already in talks with Qatar over supplying gas to the EU as a crucial substitute for Russia.\n\nHowever, during a forum of gas exporting countries held last week in Qatar, the bloc said it would be unable to provide a considerable amount of replacement gas to Europe in the event of sanctions against Russia. They stressed the need for significant investment in gas infrastructure, as well as long-term contracts, to guarantee a large supply to Europe.\n\nFilling the gap\n\nThis has led to an emerging debate about whether African countries, which have some of the world\u2019s deepest gas reserves, can step in to fill the gap \u2013 a demand of 150-190 billion cubic metres annually that Russia has usually supplied to Europe.\n\nRecently, Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan said the Russian invasion of Ukraine could prove to be an opportunity for gas sales as the East African country makes efforts to secure a new energy market outside Africa. \u201cWhether Africa or Europe or America, we are looking for markets,\u201d said Hassan. \u201cAnd fortunately, we are working with companies from Europe.\u201d\n\nTanzania, which has the sixth-largest gas reserves in Africa \u2013 an estimated 57 trillion cubic feet (1.6 billion cubic metres) of gas reserves \u2013 says it has been working with Shell to utilise its vast offshore gas resources and export to Europe and elsewhere.\n\nAfrica\u2019s largest gas producer has similar plans too. Timipre Sylva, Nigeria\u2019s junior petroleum minister, told the press at the gas exporting countries\u2019 forum in Doha, \u201cWe want to build a pipeline, a trans-Sahara pipeline, that is going to take our gas to Algeria, then to Europe.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s comments are buoyed by the recent signing of an MoU with Algeria and the Niger Republic and the ongoing construction of the Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline, a 614km (381.5 miles) long natural gas pipeline beginning in northern Nigeria.\n\nThere is no official word on when the pipeline, first mooted in the 1970s, will be completed but it is slated to run through northern Nigeria into Niger and Algeria, connecting to Europe eventually.\n\nStill there are concerns about whether African countries can become a proper stopgap solution for natural gas as Europe tackles Russia\u2019s military onslaught against one of its own \u2013 or long-term suppliers.\n\nLack of infrastructure\n\nExperts say a historic lack of investment in gas infrastructure has hampered the energy industry in sub-Saharan Africa, unlike in Northern Africa.\n\nFor instance, the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline in Algeria \u2013 Africa\u2019s largest natural gas exporter \u2013 conveys natural gas through Morocco to Spain and Portugal, and the Medgaz pipeline links Algeria directly to Spain.\n\nExperts estimated that Algeria exported 9 billion cubic feet (255 million cubic metres) of gas to Spain in 2020 and up to 17 billion cubic feet (481 million cubic metres) annually before that. The drop was due to gas production dipping in a breakdown in relations with Morocco; last October, Algeria announced that it would immediately begin exporting gas directly to Spain.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that [North] Africa already has an established gas export market with Europe [before the Ukrainian crisis],\u201d said Linda Mabhena-Olagunju, oil and gas lawyer and CEO of Johannesburg-based independent power producer DLO Energy Resource Group. \u201cThe Medgaz pipeline capacity enhancements [in Algeria] are also expected to increase exports to Europe.\u201d\n\nBut many African countries with massive gas reserves have also struggled to attract investment to build gas infrastructure projects to supply the European market.\n\nAngola, which has 13.5 trillion cubic feet (382 billion cubic metres) of proven gas reserves, has experienced a sharp decline in oil and gas production in the last five years due to a combination of technical and operational problems, as well as a lack of upstream investment and incentives.\n\nIn 2020, the Muhammadu Buhari administration announced \u201cThe Decade of Gas\u201d, a Nigerian initiative to prioritise the gas industry and take advantage of a global transition to cleaner fuels.\n\nAs part of that drive, it has commenced construction of the 614km-long, $2.5bn Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano Natural Gas Pipeline. Most of the funding comes as a loan from Chinese banks.\n\nStill, like in many other African countries, significant investments are needed to build trans-regional and intercontinental pipelines, in order to open up access to Europe. And they all need loads of capital.\n\nNigeria is hoping that its new industry legislation \u2013 signed last August \u2013 can provide a new framework to cut down on waste and corruption in the oil sector, reshape host community relations and ultimately, investment.\n\n\u201cNigeria is not presently a top investment destination for the oil and gas industry,\u201d said Joe Nwakwue, former chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers in Nigeria and ex-adviser to the junior petroleum minister. \u201cThis was why we pushed for a competitive fiscal arrangement in the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdditionally, to address the infrastructure challenge, we need to open up the sector to private capital,\u201d he said. \u201cOur current oligopoly would not suffice as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation lacks the capital to build our required infrastructure.\u201d\n\nUsing vessels for direct transport of liquefied natural gas across the seas could also put sub-Saharan African countries in prime position to become competitive producers and exporters, Mabhena-Olagunju told Al Jazeera.\n\nSecurity of supply\n\nThere are also other existential issues that experts say African countries have to fix first to be a ready alternative for Europe in situations of urgency.\n\nMozambique holds roughly 100 trillion cubic feet (2.8 trillion cubic metres) of proven natural gas reserves, accounting for approximately 1 percent of the world\u2019s total reserves. But an ongoing armed uprising in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado, a gas-rich area that borders Tanzania, has hampered activity on a planned $50bn project.\n\nElsewhere, a wave of security threats from armed groups has affected oil and gas exploration in Nigeria\u2019s oil-rich Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cThe key factor that remains a challenge for Africa as a reliable LNG producer and exporter revolves around security of supply,\u201d said Mabhena-Olagunju. \u201cWhilst the LNG discoveries in Mozambique are a great find, it is also important to recognise that insecurity leads to delays and instability of supply.\u201d\n\nCan African countries wing it?","sentiment":"positive"},{"links":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2022\/1\/27\/at-least-70-dead-from-tropical-storm-ana-in-southern-africa","title":"Dozens dead from Tropical Storm Ana in southern Africa","text":"At least 70 people were killed in a storm that struck Madagascar, Mozambique and Malawi, and authorities are scrambling to repair damages.\n\nThe death toll from a storm that struck three southern African countries rose to 70 on Thursday as emergency teams battled to repair damaged infrastructure and help tens of thousands of victims.\n\nPacking torrential rains, Tropical Storm Ana made landfall Monday in Madagascar before ploughing into Mozambique and Malawi.\n\nRescue workers and authorities across the three countries were still assessing the full extent of the damage.\n\nMadagascar has reported 41 dead, with 18 others killed in Mozambique and 11 in Malawi.\n\nRemnants of the storm have passed over Zimbabwe, but no deaths have been reported there.\n\nIn the three hardest-hit countries, tens of thousands of homes were damaged.

Even with other forces there, they say, security is uncertain outside of small, heavily guarded areas.\n\nMozambican and Rwandan forces notched up a major victory in August, when they drove the fighters out of their de facto headquarters in the port city of Mocimboa da Praia.\n\nBut violence has continued.

Nearly half of these forcibly displaced people are children.\n\n55 percent of refugees come from three countries: Syria, Palestine and Venezuela.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, \u201ceverything else has stopped, including the economies, but wars and conflict and violence and discrimination and persecution, all the factors that pushed these people to flee, have continued,\u201d UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said.\n\nRefugee journeys during 2020\n\nIn 2020, 1.27 million people from 64 countries became refugees. The infographic below shows the desperate journeys these people took despite the additional challenges brought on by COVID-19.\n\nAfrica accounts for more than one-third of the world\u2019s displaced people. By the end of 2020, at least 30.6 million people were displaced across the continent.\n\nIn 2020, nearly 60,000 refugees fled from Ethiopia to neighbouring countries following violence in several parts of the East African country. In November 2020, fighting broke out in Ethiopia\u2019s northern Tigray region displacing more than one million people according to the International Organization for Migration.\n\nIn the Middle East, Syrian refugees continued to flee their country\u2019s 10-year-long war, with nearly 134,000 recorded to have left in 2020. Half of them (65,000) fled to neighbouring Turkey, which now hosts the world\u2019s largest refugee community \u2013 3.7 million people. That same year, nearly a quarter of Syrian refugees (32,500) reached Germany.\n\nIn Latin America, nearly 400,000 refugees fled Venezuela following a political and economic crisis in the country. Of these, 139,000 were recorded fleeing to Peru, 80,000 to the Dominican Republic and 60,000 to Brazil.\n\nIn Asia, the UN recorded at least 29,000 refugees from Myanmar. Nearly all of these refugees arrived in neighbouring India (17,000) and Bangladesh (12,000).\n\nIn Europe, at least 89,000 refugees fled from Azerbaijan to Armenia following 44 days of fighting that broke out between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, during 2020, the United States received 8,500 refugees from 20 countries. Nearly half of these refugees came from only three countries: Venezuela (1,600), El Salvador (1,200), and Guatemala (1,100). This is significantly lower than in 2019 when the country received 32,000 refugees.\n\nCanada received 7,500 refugees from 21 countries in 2020. The top countries of origin were Nigeria (1,400), Iran (1,200) and Hungary (629). On the other side of the globe, Australia received only 956 refugees in 2020 \u2013 mostly from Iran.\n\nWhere are the largest refugee camps?\n\nRefugee camps are intended as temporary safe haven to meet refugees\u2019 basic needs. However, many people end up living in these camps for decades. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Kenya: \u201cMany displaced persons spend more than 16 years living as refugees in temporary shelter.\u201d\n\nThe infographic below highlights some of the largest refugee camps around the world.\n\nThe Kutupalong camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar, Bangladesh, is the world\u2019s largest refugee camp. It was set up informally in the early 1990s after Myanmar\u2019s minority Rohingya began to flee several crackdowns on them in Rakhine state.\n\nIn 2017, brutal crackdowns tore through the state and the camp had to be significantly expanded, reaching a capacity of approximately 800,000 people.\n\nOn March 22, 2021, a huge fire engulfed a neighbouring refugee camp in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Fifteen people were killed and tens of thousands were left without their homes and belongings.\n\nThe Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya comprises three large refugee camps \u2013 Hagadera, Dagahaley and Ifo \u2013 and houses more than 200,000 refugees near the border with Somalia. Dadaab was established in 1991 following the civil war in Somalia and expanded in 2011 following widespread drought and famine.\n\nThe Kakuma refugee camp in northwest Kenya is home to at least 150,000 refugees mostly from South Sudan and Somalia. The camp was established in 1992 following the arrival of thousands of Sudanese children who were fleeing the civil war.\n\nIn March 2021, Kenya\u2019s government announced that it would close the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps by June 30, 2022.\n\nThe Zaatari refugee camp was established in Jordan in 2012 to house Syrian refugees. Today, it is the largest Syrian refugee camp in the world. The world\u2019s first COVID-19 vaccination centre in a refugee camp opened there in February 2021.\n\n70 years of refugee journeys\n\nIn 1951, the UN established the 1951 Refugee Convention, set up to protect the rights of refugees in Europe in the aftermath of World War II. In 1967, the convention was expanded to address displacement across the rest of the world.\n\nThe infographic below highlights 70 years of refugee journeys, from 1951 to 2020. The number of refugees has more than doubled over the past decade from 15 million in 2011 to 30 million in 2020.\n\nThe plight of Palestinian refugees is the longest unresolved refugee problem in the world. On May 14, 1948, the British Mandate for Palestine expired, triggering the first Arab-Israeli war. Zionist militias expelled at least 750,000 Palestinians. According to figures compiled by UNHCR, by 1952 the number of Palestinian refugees was 867,000. Today, that figure is 5.7 million.\n\nAfghanistan has been ravaged by four decades of war. From 1979 to 1989, the country was a stage for one of the Cold War\u2019s last battles as Soviet troops fought a bloody guerrilla war against the Afghan mujahideen. For the next decade, the county struggled on. Just 12 years after the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan would find itself invaded again, this time by the US. The highest number of Afghan refugees was recorded in 1990 where 6.3 million refugees were reported.\n\nWhich countries host the most refugees today?\n\nAt 6.7 million people, Syrians are the biggest population of refugees today followed by Palestinians (5.7 million) and Venezuelans (4 million). As of 2020, 88 percent of the world\u2019s refugees originated from only 12 countries.\n\nOn the receiving end, 65 percent of the world\u2019s refugees are hosted by only 16 countries. Turkey hosts the most refugees (3.7 million) followed by Jordan (3 million) and Colombia (1.7 million).\n\nIn Europe, Germany is home to about 1.2 million refugees, the highest in the continent.\n\nAccording to UNHCR, developing countries host 86 percent of the world\u2019s refugees.","sentiment":"negative"},{"links":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2021\/6\/9\/dozens-of-children-mostly-girls-abducted-by-mozambique-fighters","title":"Dozens of children, mostly girls, abducted by Mozambique fighters","text":"Report by Save the Children says 51 minors taken by armed groups in conflict-hit Cabo Delgado in 2020, a figure likely an underestimate.\n\nFighters in conflict-hit northern Mozambique abducted dozens of children during raids in 2020, according to a new analysis by Save the Children.\n\nThe charity said in a report on Wednesday the \u201cabduction of children has become a new and alarmingly regular tactic by armed groups\u201d in Cabo Delgado province, where worsening fighting over the past three-and-a-half years has killed nearly 3,000 people and displaced more than 700,000, half of whom are children.\n\nSave the Children said \u201cat least 51 children, most of them girls\u201d were seized by non-state armed groups in the region last year, adding that the numbers involved were likely \u201cfar higher\u201d than its estimates, which were based on data collected by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project and reflected only reported cases.\n\nIt warned that the victims are at risk of sexual violence, early marriage and being used as fighters in the conflict.\n\n\u201cBeing abducted, witnessing abductions, experiencing attacks, being forced to flee from armed groups \u2013 these are extremely traumatising events for young children and adolescents,\u201d said Chance Briggs, the Mozambique country director for Save the Children.\n\nAttacks by an armed group known locally as al-Shabab, whose origins, analysts say, are steeped in local political, religious and economic discontent, have steadily increased in the Cabo Delgado province since October 2017.\n\nThe sophistication of the attacks has increased, too.\n\nThe fighters linked to ISIL (ISIS) have ransacked towns and gained control of key roadways, destroying infrastructure and beheading civilians.

She and her family had in August 2020 fled their fishing village to seek shelter in the town.\n\nBut seven months later, \u201carmed men entered Palma and forced the family to flee again. On the way to seek safety, the family was abducted by armed men. They all escaped except for their eldest daughter,\u201d it said, citing the teenager\u2019s father.\n\nMeanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had registered more than 2,600 appeals in Mozambique between September 2020 and April 2021 from people who lost track of family members, most of whom are young adults and children.\n\n\u201cThere is a very high number of unaccompanied children [who are] extremely vulnerable to all kinds of abuses and exploitation,\u201d said James Matthews, deputy head of the ICRC\u2019s mission in Mozambique\u2019s capital, Maputo.","sentiment":"negative"},{"links":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2021\/5\/14\/whites-prioritised-ahead-of-black-people-in-palma-rescue-amnesty","title":"White people rescued before Black people in Palma: Amnesty","text":"Rights group alleges in report citing survivors that white contractors were airlifted to safety before local Black people after March attack on Mozambican town.\n\nWhite contractors were prioritised for evacuation ahead of Black locals during a rescue operation following an attack in March by an armed group known locally as al-Shabab on the Mozambican town of Palma, according to Amnesty International.\n\nIn a report compiled from interviews with 11 Black survivors, Amnesty on Thursday charged that even dogs were pulled to safety before Black people by a helicopter that airlifted civilians from a hotel where they had sought refuge.\n\n\u201cWhite contractors [were] airlifted to safety before local Black people,\u201d said Amnesty, adding the hotel manager took his two German Shepherd dogs on the rescue helicopter, leaving people behind.\n\nDyck Advisory Group (DAG), a South Africa private company hired to help the Mozambique government fight the armed group and which was involved in the rescue operation, rejected the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe rescued 24 people from the Amarula Lodge on the 25 March 2021 this consisted of 6 white persons and 18 Black persons of differing nationalities,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe DAG team did not choose who would or would not be evacuated, they secured the landing site and loaded the people that were sent to them for evacuation by the lodge manager,\u201d it added.\n\nDyck Advisory Group reacts to Amnesty International claims that white expats and dogs were prioritised for evacuation before black Mozambiquans in Palma \"We rescued 24 people from the Amarula Lodge on the 25 March 2021 this consisted of 6 white persons and 18 black persons\" pic.twitter.com\/lRBOajooG6 \u2014 Will Brown (@_Will_Brown) May 14, 2021\n\nSome 200 people, mainly civil servants and foreigners working on a nearby gas project, sheltered in the Amarula Palma Hotel during the attack on Palma that began on March 24.\n\nAmnesty said there were about 20 white workers among the group holed up in the beachfront hotel.\n\n\u201cWhile the white contractors were prioritised to be airlifted to safety, the Black nationals were left to fend for themselves. After the majority of the white contractors and a few well-off Black nationals \u2013 among them the Administrator for Palma \u2013 were rescued, those left behind attempted to flee by ground convoy\u201d but were ambushed by al-Shabab, Amnesty said.\n\nDeprose Muchena, the rights watchdog\u2019s regional director for east and southern Africa, said \u201cthese are alarming allegations that the rescue plan was racially segregated.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbandoning people during an armed assault simply because of the colour of their skin is racism, and violates the obligation to protect civilians,\u201d he said, adding that for the hotel manager to \u201cchoose to rescue his dogs instead of people is also extremely shocking\u201d.\n\nOne survivor told Amnesty that \u201cwe didn\u2019t want all white people to be rescued, because we knew that if all the whites left, we would be left there to die.
